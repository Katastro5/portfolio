      <div class="about-content">
        <p>Hello! My name is Angelos Tatsis, also known as Katastro5. I am a guy who loves to play and make video games. Most of the games I make are on Roblox, but in the future, I am planning to make games and applications outside of Roblox. My dream job is to become a successful programmer one day.</p>
        <p>I am also a content creator who uploads videos related to my games on my YouTube channel. I rarely, if ever, do live streams, but in case I do, I have a Twitch account as well.</p>
        <p>I work for my Roblox group "Boom Boom Studio", where all my games are associated with "Mickey Mouse Peanuts" and "Ronnector". I am doing my best to update these games as it is not easy for me because at the same time, I am learning how to create them.</p>
        <p>Thank you, guys, for supporting me, and in case I become successful in the future or something like that, I will always remember how I started and which people supported me. ❤️</p>

          <p class="project-description">Mickey Mouse Peanuts is a game on Roblox. The game's goal is to find the hidden badges all over the map and, more specifically, to have fun! Playing with your friends will make this game much funnier. I made this with the knowledge of making a game that you won't get addicted to, like you can play this game for a maximum 5 minutes, and with the knowledge of not making a game pay to win. That's why we are selling only one thing, and that's pretty cheap. The only way we are getting financial support is through donations.</p>
